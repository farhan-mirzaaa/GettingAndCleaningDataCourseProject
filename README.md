## Introduction

This repo is for my Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data Course" project. In this project, raw data downloaded from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) to create a tidy data set.

This repo contains the four files:

1.  **README.md** contains the repo information
2.  **tidy_data.txt**_ contains the final output after analysis
3.  **run_analysis.R**_ is the script file which converts the input data into tidy dataset
4.  **codebook.md** contains the code book for **run_analysis.R**_ to understand it
